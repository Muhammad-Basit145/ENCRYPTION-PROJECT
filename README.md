# ENCRYPTION-PROJECT
Project Title:
 -Image Encryption and Decryption using Python Programming.

Background and Description of the project:
Encryption of data is very important as it saves us from unauthorized access or the misuse. 
In this project, firstly the image is encrypted and then it is decrypted using both encryption and decryption keys.

Aims and Objectives:
Currently safety is one of the primary concerns in the transmission of images due to increasing the use of images within the industrial applications. So itâ€™s necessary to secure the image facts from unauthorized individuals. There are various strategies investigated to secure the facts. Encryption is certainly one of the most distinguished methods. So the main aim is to protect the images transmission from misuse or unauthorized access.

Methodology of the project:
First, we will select an image, and then we will convert that image into a byte array due to which the image data will be totally converted into numeric form, and then we can easily apply the XOR operation on it. Now, whenever we will apply the XOR function on each value of the byte array then the data will be changed due to which we will be unable to access it. But we should remember one thing that here our encryption key plays a very important role without that key we can not decrypt our image. It acts as a password to decrypt it.


Working:
In the execution of the code it will ask for the url or address of the desired image which you want to encrypt and then ask for the encryption key. As the address and key will be given to it, it will encrypt that image into the code. Same it works for the decryption method, the address of the encrypted image will be provided to it along with the description key to decrypt the image and then return the function.
